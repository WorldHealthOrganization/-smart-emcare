If the caregiver didn't notice the yellow discolouration or can't remember when it started, select \"don't know\". \nJaundice that appears in less than 24 hours after birth is always due to an underlying disease. These babies should be referred urgently. \nMany normal babies, particularly small babies, may have jaundice during the first week of life. This jaundice usually appears on the third or fourth day of life and is mild and disappears before the age of two to\u00a0 three weeks. It does not need any treatment.",
