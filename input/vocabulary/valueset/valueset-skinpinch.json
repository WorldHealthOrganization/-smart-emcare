    "description": "Locate the area on the infant\u2019s abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. To do the skin pinch, use your thumb and first finger. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. Place \nyour hand so that when you pinch the skin, the fold of skin will be in a line up and down the child\u2019s body and not across the child\u2019s \nbody. Firmly pick up all of the layers of skin and the tissue under them. Pinch the skin for \none second and then release it. When you release the skin, look to see if the skin pinch \ngoes back:\n\u2022 immediately\n\u2022 slowly (2 seconds or fewer, but not immediately)\n\u2022 very slowly (longer than 2 seconds)\nIf the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly",
