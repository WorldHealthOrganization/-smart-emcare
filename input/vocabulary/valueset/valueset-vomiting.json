A child who vomits everything will not be able to hold down food, fluids, or oral drugs. A child who vomits several times but can hold down some fluids has \"vomiting, but not everything\".\n\nWhen you ask the question, use words that the caregiver understands. Give her time to answer. If the caregiver is not sure if the child is vomiting everything, help her to make her answer clear. For example, ask the caregiver how often the child vomits. Also ask if each time the child swallows food or fluids, does the child vomit? If you are not sure of the caregiver\u2019s answers, ask her to offer the child a drink. See if the child vomits.",
