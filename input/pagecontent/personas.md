# Generic Personas

A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or “end-user”, of the system. Although the specific roles and demographic profile of the personas will vary depending on the setting, the generic personas are based on the WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas. Please note that these are developed based on synthesis across multiple contexts as a starting point, and further contextualization will be required according to the needs, motivations and challenges of the targeted personas in each setting.
