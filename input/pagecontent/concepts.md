| Implementation Guide                       | A set of rules of how a particular interoperability or standards problem is solved though the use of FHIR resources. This implementation guide is based on the WHO guidance, as represented in the Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK): SMART Guidelines for Critical Care in Crisis, to support the adaptation of open standards for interoperability.                                                            |
| Digital Adaptation Kit                     | Digital adaptation kits are part of the SMART guidelines initiative in include data and health content consistent with the WHO recommendations, generally applicable to digital systems. They are software neutral, operational and structured documentation based on WHO clinica, helath system and data use recommendations to systematically and transparently inform the design of digital systems.     |
| Functional Requirements                    | Functional requirements defines functions of a system or its components, where a function is described as a summery of behaviour between inputs and outputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Non functional requirements                | Non-functional requirements are requirements that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours in contrast to the functional requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Clinical Quality Language                  | Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a high-level domain-specific language focused on clinical quality and targeted at measures and decision support artifact authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources | Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It provides the syntactic interoperability in health information exchange.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Data Dictionary                            | A centralized repository of information about data elements that contain their definitions, relationships, origins, usage and type of data.

| Data Element                               | A unit of data that has a specific and precise meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Indicator                                  | Summary measures that capture relevant information on different attributes and dimensions of health status and performance of a health system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Clinical Practice Guidelines               | Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) provides a means of creating a computable representation of narrative clinical guideline that is faithful to guideline intent and supports the derivation of downstream capabilities such as cognitive and decsion support, quality measures, case reporting and documentation templates that direct clinical documentation in support determining guideline compliance. |
