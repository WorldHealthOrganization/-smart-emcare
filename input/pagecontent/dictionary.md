Avoid putting things in the mouth. - Give 0.5mg/kg diazepam rectally - Check for low blood sugar, then treat or prevent. - Give oxygen and REFER - If convulsions have not stopped after 10 minutes repeat diazepam dose                                                                                                                                                                                    |              Select one             |    Boolean   |                                                                    - Yes - No                                                                    |    nan    |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                R               |                                                          nan                                                          |               nan              |                   IMCI chart booklet (who.int)                  |If the answer to this is yes it will route directly to Life-threatening Illness This ICD-11 code refers to Age >=28 days|      8A68.Z,KB06      |                                       Type of seizure, unspecified (Index Term: Convulsions, convulsive state),Neonatal seizures                                       |                    http://id.who.int/icd/entity/539646260 http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2083324835                   |                                          https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/539646260/mms/unspecified https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f2083324835                                          |                equivalent                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Target code does not indicate "now" it only codes convulsions of unspecified type.,Target code does not indicate "now" it only codes convulsions in neonates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |      R56.8,P90     |                                      Other and unspecified convulsions,Convulsions of newborn                                      |                       https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/R56.8 https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/P90                       |           equivalent           |                                                                                                                  Target code does not indicate "now" it only codes convulsions Target code does not indicate "now" it only codes convulsions in newborn                                                                                                                  |  Not classifiable |        Not classifiable       |                    Not classifiable                   |               unmatched              |                                                                                              nan                                                                                             |           9117500087476000           |     Seizure (finding) synonym: Convulsion,Convulsions in the newborn (disorder)     |                                                           https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=91175000&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=87476004&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en                                                          |                         inexact                         |                                                                       Target code does not indicate "now" it only codes convulsions of unspecified type.

For example, the caregiver may call convulsions “fits” or “spasms.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |              Select all             |     Codes    |                                                          - Convulsion(s) in this Illness                                                         |    nan    |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                          "Age">=2 'months' and "Age"< 5 'years' and "Convulsing Now" = false                          |               nan              |                   IMCI chart booklet (who.int)                  |                                                           nan                                                          |         8A68.Z        |                                                Type of seizure, unspecified (Index Term: Convulsions, convulsive state)                                                |                                        http://id.who.int/icd/entity/539646260                                       |                                                                                     https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/539646260/mms/unspecified                                                                                     |                equivalent                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |        R56.8       |                                                  Other and unspecified convulsions                                                 |                                            https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/R56.8                                            |           equivalent           |                                                                                                                                                                                    nan                                                                                                                                                                                   |  Not classifiable |        Not classifiable       |                    Not classifiable                   |               unmatched              |                                                                                              nan                                                                                             |               91175000               |                        Seizure (finding) synonym: Convulsion                        |                                                                                                                     https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=91175000&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en                                                                                                                    |                        equivalent                       |                                                                                                                                             nan                                                                                                                                             | Not classifiable |    Not classifiable    | Not classifiable| Not classifiable |              unmatched              |                  nan                  |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

The child is drowsy and does not show interest in what is happening around her.  Often the lethargic child does not look at his caregiver or watch your face when you talk, or will not respond if you clap or snap your fingers. The child may stare blankly and appear not to notice what is going on around him.  An unconscious child cannot be wakened. He does not respond when he is touched, shaken, or spoken to. Ask the caregiver if the child seems unusually sleepy or if she cannot wake the child. Look to see if the child wakens when the caregiver talks or shakes the child or when you clap your hands.                                                                                                                |              Select all             |     Codes    |                                                            - Unconscious or Lethargic                                                            |    nan    |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                                         "Age">=2 'months' and "Age"< 5 'years'                                        |               nan              |                   IMCI chart booklet (who.int)                  |                                                           nan                                                          |      MB20.1,MG22      |                                                  Coma (index term: Unconsciousness, NOS),Fatigue (inclusion: lethargy)                                                 |                   http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1328725971 http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1109546957                   |                                                         https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1328725971 https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1109546957                                                         |                equivalent                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |      R40.2,R53     |                      Coma, unspecified (synonym: Unconsciousness NOS),Malaise and fatigue (includes: Lethargy)                     |                        https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#R40.2 https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/R53                       |           equivalent           |                                                                                                                                                                                    nan                                                                                                                                                                                   |LA17711-5,LA25161-3|     Unconscious,Lethargic     |https://loinc.org/LL1817-7/ https://loinc.org/LL3828-2/|              equivalent              |                       Answer ID from the answer list name: NEMSIS_30_barriers to care (LL1817-7),Answer ID from the answer list name: Level of consciousness (LL3828-2)                      |          418107008,214264003         |                       Unconscious (finding),Lethargy (finding)                      |                                                          https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=418107008&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=214264003&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en                                                         |                        equivalent                       |                                                                                                                                             nan                                                                                                                                             | Not classifiable |    Not classifiable    | Not classifiable| Not classifiable |              unmatched              |                  nan                  |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

When you ask the caregiver if the child is able to drink, make sure that she understands the question. If she says that her child is not able to drink or breastfeed, ask her to describe what happens when she offers the child something to drink. For example, is the child able to take fluid into his mouth and swallow it? If you are not sure about the caregiver’s answer, ask her to offer the child a drink of clean water or breast milk. Look to see if the child is swallowing the water or breast milk.  A child who is breastfed may have difficulty sucking when his nose is blocked. If the child’s nose is blocked, clear it. If the child can breastfeed after the nose is cleared, the child does not have the danger sign, “not able to drink or breastfeed.”|              Select all             |     Codes    |                                                         - Not able to drink or breastfeed                                                        |    nan    |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                                         "Age">=2 'months' and "Age"< 5 'years'                                        |               nan              |                   IMCI chart booklet (who.int)                  |                                                           nan                                                          |    Not classifiable   |                                                                            Not classifiable                                                                            |                                                   Not classifiable                                                  |                                                                                                                           Not classifiable                                                                                                                          |                 unmatched                |No ICD code reflects the child's inability to drink or breastfeed because they are too sick to eat (as in the intended meaning here).

If high fever, give paracetamol  Temperature ranges for young infants under 2 months: - Under 35.5 : hypothermia (low body temperature) - 35.5 to 37.9 : normal  - 38.0 and above : fever If the high or low temperature is the only severe sign, repeat the measurement after 30 minutes. In the meantime, remove clothing and let the baby who has fever cool. If the baby has hypothermia in winter, wrap the baby to warm her. Use the second reading to decide if the infant has fever or low temperature.                                                                                             |                 nan                 | Quantity|                          nan                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Decimal Quantity|                        Range 32 to 45 degree celsius.

Use the second reading to decide if the infant has fever or low body temperature.                                                                                                               |                 nan                 | Derived |           - Low - Normal - High - Very High          |Auto calculated based on axillary temperature -Low = <35.5 -Normal = (age <2m AND Temp >=35.5 AND temp <38.0) OR (Age >=2m AND temp >=35.5 AND temp <37.5) High = (age <2m AND temp >=38.0) OR (age >=2m AND temp >=37.5 AND temp <38.5) Very high = Age>=2m AND Temp >=38.5  If rectal temp is used -Low = <36 Normal = (age <2m AND Temp >=36 AND temp <38.5) OR (Age >=2m AND temp >=36 AND temp <38) High = (age <2m AND temp >=38.5) OR (age >=2m AND temp >=38 AND temp <39) Very high = Age>=2m AND Temp >=39"|       nan       |                                               nan                                               |   No   |                C               |                        "Axillary Temperature (degrees Celcius)" != null OR "Rectal Temperature (degrees Celcius)" != null                       |               nan              |                                                                                                 nan                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                         nan                                                                                                                                                         |          nan          |                           nan                          |                  nan                  |                                         nan                                        |                    nan                   |                                                                    nan                                                                   |         nan        |                                 nan                                 |                    nan                    |               nan              |                                                                    nan                                                                   |        nan        |                      nan                      |            nan           |                  nan                 |                                        nan                                        |                  nan                 |                                                            nan                                                            |                                                         nan                                                         |                           nan                           |                                                                    nan                                                                   |        nan       |                                 nan                                 |                  nan                  |                                           nan                                          |                 nan                 |                                                                        nan                                                                       |       nan      |        nan        |       nan      |               nan              |                nan               |            nan           |

Length is used for children under 2 years, or those too weak or unable to stand. One assistant should hold the child’s head over the ears and with straight arms. The measurer hold one hand on the child’s knees keeping the legs straight and the other on the foot-place to read the length. The child should lie flat on the board.  Provided that weight has been measured, length for weight z-score will be calculated automatically                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                 nan                 | Quantity|                          nan                         |                                                                                                                                                                FOR a child <2 years where length has been measured instead of height THEN minus 0.7cm from the length measurement that is entered and record this calculation as a height measurement                                                                                                                                                               | Decimal Quantity|Exact Length in centimeters to 1 decimal place  Length should be between 35.0 - 140.0 centimeters|   Yes  |                C               |   ("Age" < 2 'years old' and "Prefer to measure height" != true and "Length cannot be measured" != true) or "Prefer to measure length" = true   |               nan              |                       Child growth standards (who.int)  https://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/Technical_report.pdf"  https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241515559                      |                                                                                       Full correct terminology used by WHO is: “Recumbent length”.

To measure: - Find the mid-point of the child’s upper arm between the shoulder and elbow. - Use MUAC tape to mark the midpoint on the child’s arm. - Hold the large end of the strap against the arm at the midpoint of the arm. - Put the other end of the strap around the child’s arm. Thread the end up through the second small slit in the strap. The end will come from behind. - Pull both ends until the strap fits closely. It should not be so tight that it makes folds in the skin. It should also not be too loose. - Gently press the window. At the marks note the measurement and colour                                                                                                                                                 |                 nan                 | Quantity|                          nan                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Decimal Quantity|                                   Exact Length in millimeters                                   |   Yes  |                C               |                                                                "Age" >=6 'months'                                                               |               nan              |                                                                      https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software                                                                      |                                                                               Official R and stata packages to calculate z-scores using the official UNICEF/WHO methodology: https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards/software                                                                              |    Not classifiable   |                    Not classifiable                    |            Not classifiable           |                                  Not classifiable                                  |                 unmatched                |                                                                    nan                                                                   |  Not classifiable  |                           Not classifiable                          |              Not classifiable             |            unmatched           |                                                                    nan                                                                   |      56072-2      |      Circumference Mid upper arm - right      |https://loinc.org/56072-2/|              equivalent              |                                     Trial code                                    |               284473002              |                                      Mid upper arm circumference (observable entity)                                      | https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=284473002&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en|                        equivalent                       |                                                                    nan                                                                   |     PMA.AB.ZZ    |  Body measurement of upper limb (index term: Measuring upper limb)  | http://id.who.int/icd/entity/378736352|https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-ichi/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f1012812007|            inexact/wider            |This codes the procedure done (i.e., that the patient's MUAC was measured).

They may say that their child’s breathing is “fast” or “noisy” or “interrupted.” If a mother answers no, look to see if you think the child has cough or difficult breathing.                                                                          |        Select all that Apply       |  Codes  |                                        - Difficulty Breathing                                        |                                                                              nan                                                                             |                     nan                    |         nan        |   Yes  |                O               |                               nan                              |               nan              |             IMCI chart booklet (who.int)            | nan |         MD11.5        |                            Dyspnoea  (index term: difficulty breathing)                            |                    http://id.who.int/icd/entity/960305085                   |                                                    https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f960305085                                                    |                equivalent                |                                                                                                               nan                                                                                                               |        R06.0       |                                               Dyspnoea                                              |                       https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#R06.0                      |           equivalent           |                                                                    nan                                                                   |         82950-7         |                                                Dyspnea [ALSFRS-R]                                               |               https://loinc.org/82950-7/              |              equivalent              |                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                      |               230145002              |                          Difficulty breathing (finding)                          |                                                          https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=230145002&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en                                                          |                        equivalent                       |                                                                                         nan                                                                                         | Not classifiable |    Not classifiable    | Not classifiable| Not classifiable |              unmatched              |                  nan                  |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

In children, diarrhoea is defined as three or more loose or watery stools in a 24-hour period. In young infants, diarrhoea is defined as stools which have changed from the usual pattern, and are many and watery. This means more water than faecal matter.

You will look for chest indrawing when the child breathes IN.  In normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the child breathes IN. The child has chest indrawing if the lower chest wall (lower ribs) goes IN when the child breathes IN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              - Yes - No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                               nan                                                                                               |           nan           |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                                                                        "Cough" = true or "Difficulty Breathing" = true                                                                        |               nan              |             IMCI chart booklet (who.int)            |                                                  nan                                                 |    Not classifiable   |                                                                                     Not classifiable                                                                                     |                                                                        Not classifiable                                                                        |                                                                                                                   Not classifiable                                                                                                                   |                 unmatched                |                                                                  nan                                                                  |  Not classifiable  |                                                                      Not classifiable                                                                      |                                    Not classifiable                                   |            unmatched           |                                                                  nan                                                                  |                 LA32284-4                 |         Change in breathing (e.g., indrawing, irregular, faster than usual, gagging, or breath holding)         |                           https://loinc.org/LL5947-8/                           |                 wider                |                                                                        Target not specific to indrawing.

Put your ear near the child’s mouth because stridor can be difficult to hear. Sometimes you will hear a wet noise if the child’s nose is blocked. Clear the nose, and listen again.  Be sure to look and listen for stridor when the child is calm.  A child who is not very ill may have stridor only when he is crying or upset. However, a child who is calm and also has stridor has a dangerous situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

After turning on, position the appropriate probe based on the child's size. If using on a finger or toe, make sure the area is clean and without nail varnish. Ensure that a good (even) pulse signal (waveform) is displayed before taking the reading. If uncertain that the probe is working, check by testing on your own finger.  Normal oxygen saturation at sea level is 95 - 100%. Oxygen should be given if saturation drops to less than 90%, and may be needed for children with severe illness if SpO2 less than 94%. Different cut-offs may be used at high altitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                 nan                                |    Integer    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                               nan                                                                                               |Whole Number -

Decide if you think the eyes are sunken. Then ask the mother if she thinks her child’s eyes look unusual. Her opinion can help you confirm. NOTE: In a severely malnourished child who is wasted, the eyes may always look sunken, even if the child is not dehydrated. Still use the sign to classify dehydration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

ASK the mother to place the child on the examining table so that the child is flat on his back with his arms at his sides (not over his head) and his legs straight. Or, ask the mother to hold the child so he is lying flat on her lap. 2. USE YOUR THUMB AND FIRST FINGER to locate the area on the child’s abdomen halfway between the umbilicus and the side of the abdomen. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body. 3. PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them. 4. HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it. 5.. LOOK to see if the skin pinch goes back very slowly (more than 2 seconds), slowly, (less than 2 seconds, but not immediately), or immediately. If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                             Select one                             |    Coding     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 -

If an infant or child is calm when breastfeeding but again restless and irritable when he stops breastfeeding, s/he has the sign restless and irritable. Many children are upset just because they are in the clinic. Usually these children can be consoled and calmed, and do not have this sign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

It requires urgent treatment with injectable antibiotics and referral to a hospital. WATCH THE CHILD: While you talk with the caregiver during the assessment, look to see if the child moves and bends his or her neck easily when looking around. If the child is moving and bending his or her neck, the child does not have a stiff neck. TEST THE CHILD: If you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the child’s attention to his or her umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a flashlight on the toes or umbilicus or tickle the toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his or her neck when looking down at his or her umbilicus or toe FEEL FOR STIFF NECK:If you still have not seen the child bend his or her neck himself, ask the caregiver to help you lay the child on his or her back. Lean over the child, gently support the child’s back and shoulders with one hand. With the other hand, hold the child’s head. Then carefully bend the head forward towards the child’s chest. If the neck bends easily, the child does not have stiff neck. If the neck feels stiff and there is resistance to bending, the child has a stiff neck. Often a child with a stiff neck will cry when you try to bend the neck.                                                  |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              - Yes - No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                               nan                                                                                               |           nan           |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                                                                                         "Fever" = true                                                                                        |                                |https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241516365|                                                                                                      |          FA71         |                                                                                      Neck stiffness                                                                                      |                                                             http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1964135725                                                            |                                                                                  https://icd.who.int/dev11/f/en#http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f1964135725                                                                                  |                equivalent                |                 This ICD-11 entity has its individual URI.

Feel behind both ears. Compare them and decide if there is tender swelling of the mastoid bone. In infants, the swelling may be above the ear. Do not confuse this swelling of the bone with swollen lymph nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

Conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva, the inside surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eye. If you do not see pus draining from the eye, look for pus on the conjunctiva or on the eyelids. Often the pus forms a crust when the child is sleeping and seals the eye shut. You can gently open the eye, making sure that your hands are clean. Wash your hands after examining the eye of any child with pus draining from the eye.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

When clouding of the cornea is present, the cornea may appear clouded or hazy. The cornea may look the way a glass of water looks when you add a small amount of milk. The clouding may occur in one or both eyes. A child with corneal clouding may keep his or her eyes tightly shut when exposed to light. The light may cause irritation and pain to the child’s eyes. To check the child’s eye, wait for the child to open his or her eye. Or gently pull down the lower eyelid to look for clouding. Corneal clouding is a dangerous condition. It may be the result of vitamin A deficiency that has been made worse by measles. If the corneal clouding is not treated, the cornea can ulcerate and cause blindness. A child with clouding of the cornea needs urgent treatment with vitamin A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

If the caregiver is certain that clouding has been there for some time, ask if the clouding has already been assessed and treated at the hospital. If it has, you do not need to refer this child again for corneal clouding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

It spreads to the face. During the next day, the rash spreads to the rest of the body, arms and legs. After 4 to 5 days, the rash starts to fade and the skin may peel.  Some children with severe infection may have more rash spread over more of the body. The rash becomes more discoloured (dark brown or blackish), and there is more peeling of the skin. A measles rash does not have vesicles (blisters) or pustules. The rash does not itch.  Do not confuse measles with other common childhood rashes such as chicken pox, scabies, or heat rash. Chicken pox rash is a generalized rash with vesicles. Scabies occurs on the hands, feet, ankles, elbows, buttocks and axilla (underarm). It also itches. Heat rash can be a generalized rash with small bumps and vesicles, which itch. A child with heat rash is not sick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

Ulcers are painful open sores on the inside of the mouth and lips or the tongue. They may be red or have white coating.  Severe mouth ulcers are 'Deep and extensive' and require referral.  If the child has measles, note that mouth ulcers are different than the small, irregular, bright red spots with a white spot in the centre called Koplik spots which occur inside the cheek during early stages of the measles infection.

Hold the child’s palm open by grasping it gently from the side. Do not stretch the fingers backwards. This may cause pallor by blocking the blood supply. Compare the colour of the child’s palm with your own palm and with the palms of other children. The child has some palmar pallor if the skin of the child’s palm is pale. The child has severe palmar pallor if the skin of the palm is very pale or so pale that it looks white.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                             Select one                             |      Code     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -

LOOK and FEEL to determine if the child has oedema of both feet. Using your thumbs, press the topside of both feet simultaneously for 3 seconds on the top side of each foot. The child has oedema if a dent remains in the child’s foot when you lift your thumb. Oedema is when an unusually large amount of fluid gathers in the child’s tissues. The tissues become filled with the fluid and look swollen or puffed up. If a child has oedema of both feet they should be referred to inpatient care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                             Select one                             |    Boolean    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -

For example, the caregiver may know convulsions as “fits” or “spasms.” During a convulsion, the young infant’s arms and legs may become stiff. The infant may stop breathing and become blue. Many times there may only be rhythmic movements of a part of the body, such as rhythmic twitching of the mouth or blinking of eyes. The young infant may lose consciousness.                                                                                                                           |             Select One             | Boolean |                         - Yes - No                        |    nan    |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |"Convulsing Now" = false|               nan              |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)| nan |      KB06,8A68.Z      |Neonatal seizures (index term: convulsions in newborn),"Type of seizure, unspecified (index term: Convulsions)"|http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2083324835 http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1889822561|https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f2083324835 https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f539646260%2fmms%2funspecified|                equivalent                |                                                                                 nan                                                                                |      P90,R56.8     |        Convulsions of newborn,"Other and unspecified convulsions  (synonym: Seizure (convulsive) NOS)"        |  https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#P90 https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/R56  |           equivalent           |                                                                                nan                                                                                |  Not classifiable |        Not classifiable       |      Not classifiable     |               unmatched              |                   nan                  |           87476004,91175000          |Convulsions in the newborn (disorder),Seizure (finding)| https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=87476004&edition=MAIN/2022-01-31&release=&languages=en https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=91175000&edition=MAIN/2022-01-31&release=&languages=en|                        equivalent                       |                               nan                               | Not classifiable |    Not classifiable    | Not classifiable| Not classifiable |              unmatched              |                  nan                  |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |
| CHE.B18.Symptoms|    CHE.B18S1.DE02   |Possible Serious Bacterial Infection or Very Severe Disease|  Difficulty with Feeding  |Any difficulty mentioned by the mother is important. A newborn that has not been able to feed since birth may be premature or may have complications such as birth asphyxia. These infants who are either not able to feed or are not feeding well should be referred urgently to hospital.  The caregiver may also mention difficulties such as: her infant feeds too frequently (or not frequently enough), she does not have enough milk, her nipples are sore, or she has flat or inverted nipples. You will assess these difficulties later during breastfeeding assessment.

Lift the young infant’s shirt.   Look for chest indrawing when the young infant breathes in. Lower chest wall indrawing is the inward movement of the bony structure of the chest wall  when the child breathes in. Look at the lower chest wall (lower ribs). The child has chest indrawing if the lower chest wall goes IN when the child breathes IN. In normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the child breathes IN.   Mild chest indrawing is normal in a young infant because the chest wall is soft. Severe chest indrawing is very deep and easy to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                Select One                                                |    Boolean    |                                                                  - Yes - No                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                                                      |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                R               |                                                          nan                                                          |               nan              |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|                                                  nan                                                 |    Not classifiable   |                                                                                                                      Not classifiable                                                                                                                     |                               Not classifiable                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Not classifiable                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 unmatched                |                                                                                                            nan                                                                                                            |  Not classifiable  |                                                                    Not classifiable                                                                    |                                    Not classifiable                                   |            unmatched           |                                                                                      nan                                                                                      |      LA32284-4      |Change in breathing (e.g., indrawing, irregular, faster than usual, gagging, or breath holding)|https://loinc.org/LL5947-8/|                 wider                |                                            Target not specific to indrawing.

Does the young infant move on his/her own? Does the infant move only when stimulated but then stops? Does the infant not move at all? Young infants often sleep most of the time, and this is not a sign of illness. It is not necessary for the infant to be awake if he/she is moving spontaneously.  If a young infant is not moving spontaneously and does not wake up during the assessment, ask the caregiver to wake him. An awake young infant will normally move his arms or legs or turn his head several times in a  minute if you watch him closely. If the infant is awake but has no spontaneous movements, gently stimulate the young infant. Stimulation  is a gentle, painless touching of the baby with enough pressure that would evoke movements, sound making and eye opening. The presence of any movement such as a grimace of the face, eye-opening or movement of a limb will qualify "Movement only when stimulated but then stops".

Jaundice in the palms of hands or soles of feet is a sign of Severe Jaundice.  It is important to look for jaundice in natural light. To assess for severe jaundice, press the infant's skin in the palm of there hand and then in the sole of their feet with your fingers to blanch, remove your finders and look for yellow dicoulouration in the palm or the sole. If there is yellow discoloration of the palm or sole, the infant has severe jaundice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                Select One                                                |    Boolean    |                                                                  - Yes - No                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                                                      |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                R               |                                                          nan                                                          |               nan              |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|                                                  nan                                                 |         KA87.Z        |                                                                                       Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, unspecified (index term: Neonatal jaundice NOS)                                                                                       |                    http://id.who.int/icd/entity/628615515                    |                                                                                                                                                                                             https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f628615515                                                                                                                                                                                            |                  inexact                 |                                           best fit as there is no specific code for yellow palms and soles in ICD.

If the caregiver didn't notice the yellow discolouration or can't remember when it started, select "don't know".  Jaundice that appears in less than 24 hours after birth is always due to an underlying disease. These babies should be referred urgently.  Many normal babies, particularly small babies, may have jaundice during the first week of life. This jaundice usually appears on the third or fourth day of life and is mild and disappears before the age of two to  three weeks.

In a low-weight infant, the eyes may always look sunken, even if the young infant is not dehydrated. Even though the sign “sunken eyes” is less reliable in a low-weight infant, it can still be used to classify the young infant‘s dehydration.   Decide if you think the eyes are sunken. Then ask the mother if she thinks her child’s eyes look unusual. Her opinion can help you confirm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                Select One                                                |    Boolean    |                                                                  - Yes - No                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                                                      |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                                                   "Diarrhoea" = true                                                  |               nan              |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|                                                  nan                                                 |    Not classifiable   |                                                                                                                      Not classifiable                                                                                                                     |                               Not classifiable                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Not classifiable                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 unmatched                |                                                                                                            nan                                                                                                            |  Not classifiable  |                                                                    Not classifiable                                                                    |                                    Not classifiable                                   |            unmatched           |                                                                                      nan                                                                                      |   Not classifiable  |                                        Not classifiable                                       |      Not classifiable     |               unmatched              |                                                                                            nan                                                                                            |               246923005              |                                                Sunken eyes (finding)                                               |                                                          https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=246923005&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en                                                          |                        equivalent                       |                                           nan                                           | Not classifiable |                                        Not classifiable                                       |            Not classifiable           |                              Not classifiable                              |              unmatched              |                                                                 nan                                                                |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

To do the skin pinch, use your thumb and first finger. Do not use your fingertips because this will cause pain. Place  your hand so that when you pinch the skin, the fold of skin will be in a line up and down the child’s body and not across the child’s  body. Firmly pick up all of the layers of skin and the tissue under them. Pinch the skin for  one second and then release it. When you release the skin, look to see if the skin pinch  goes back: • immediately • slowly (2 seconds or fewer, but not immediately) • very slowly (longer than 2 seconds) If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                Select One                                                |     Coding    |- Goes back Very slowly (more than 2 seconds) - Goes back Slowly (2 seconds or fewer, but not immediately) - Goes back Normally (immediately)|                                                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                                                      |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                                                   "Diarrhoea" = true                                                  |               nan              |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|                                                  nan                                                 |    Not classifiable   |                                                                                                                      Not classifiable                                                                                                                     |                               Not classifiable                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Not classifiable                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 unmatched                |                                                                                                            nan                                                                                                            |  Not classifiable  |                                                                    Not classifiable                                                                    |                                    Not classifiable                                   |            unmatched           |                                                                                      nan                                                                                      |       LL3921-5      |                                          Skin turgor                                          |https://loinc.org/LL3921-5/|                 wider                |                                                                               Target not specific to abdomen                                                                              |                26669000              |                                           Skin turgor (observable entity)                                          |                                                           https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=26669000&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en                                                          |                           wider                         |                              Target not specific to abdomen                             | Not classifiable |                                        Not classifiable                                       |            Not classifiable           |                              Not classifiable                              |              unmatched              |                                                                 nan                                                                |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

A young infant is low weight for age if the z-score is below -2.  A young infant who is less than 7 days old and weighs less than 2 kg is considered very low weight.

You need to know if the infant is mostly breastfed, or mostly fed on other foods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                Select One                                                |    Boolean    |                                                                  - Yes - No                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                                                      |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                "Breastfed" = true and "YI severe classification other than severe dehydration" != true                |               nan              |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|                                                  nan                                                 |    Not classifiable   |                                                                                                                      Not classifiable                                                                                                                     |                               Not classifiable                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Not classifiable                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 unmatched                |                                                                                                            nan                                                                                                            |  Not classifiable  |                                                                    Not classifiable                                                                    |                                    Not classifiable                                   |            unmatched           |                                                                                      nan                                                                                      |   Not classifiable  |                                        Not classifiable                                       |      Not classifiable     |               unmatched              |                                                                                            nan                                                                                            |               268472006              |                                             Infant bottle fed (finding)                                            |                                                          https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=268472006&edition=MAIN/2022-01-31&release=&languages=en                                                          |                         inexact                         |                refers to bottle feeding but does not include "other food"               | Not classifiable |                                        Not classifiable                                       |            Not classifiable           |                              Not classifiable                              |              unmatched              |                                                                 nan                                                                |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

The white patches of thrush will remain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                Select One                                                |    Boolean    |                                                                  - Yes - No                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                                                                      |       nan       |         nan        |   Yes  |                C               |                            "YI severe classification other than severe dehydration" !=true                            |               nan              |             nan            |                                                  nan                                                 |     KA63.2,1F23.0     |                                                Neonatal candidosis (index term: neonatal thrush), Acute pseudomembranous oral candidosis (Oral thrush) (under: Candidosis of lips or oral mucous membranes)                                               |http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1080592090 http://id.who.int/icd/entity/695436427|                                                                                                                                                                                             https://icd.who.int/dev11/l-m/en#http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f1080592090                                                                                                                                                                                            |                equivalent                |                                                                                                            nan                                                                                                            |    P37.5, B37.0    |                                            Neonatal candidiasis,"Candidal stomatitis (synonym: Oral thrush)"                                           |                       https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#P37.5                      |           equivalent           |                                                                                      nan                                                                                      |   Not classifiable  |                                        Not classifiable                                       |      Not classifiable     |               unmatched              |                                                                                            nan                                                                                            |          746223006, 79740000         |  Neonatal infection of mouth caused by Candida (disorder), Candidiasis of mouth (disorder) (synonym: Oral thrush)  |https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=746223006&edition=MAIN/2022-01-31&release=&languages=en https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&conceptId1=79740000&edition=MAIN/2021-07-31&release=&languages=en|                        equivalent                       |                                           nan                                           | Not classifiable |                                        Not classifiable                                       |            Not classifiable           |                              Not classifiable                              |              unmatched              |                                                                 nan                                                                |Not classifiable|  Not classifiable |Not classifiable|            unmatched           |                nan               |

It is very important that the child is calm and still. If the child is moving or crying, you will not be able to get an accurate count of breaths.  To count the breaths per minute, use a watch with a second hand or a digital watch. Look for the breathing movement anywhere on the child’s chest or abdomen.   Caution: The rise and fall of the chest or abdomen counts as one breath, not two.  The number of breaths for ‘fast breathing’ depends on the child’s age.  - Under 2 months: Greater than or eqal to 60 breaths per minute* - 2 to 11 months: Greater than or eqal to 50 breaths per minute - 12 to 59 months: Greater than or eqal to 40 breaths per minute  *In young infants, a second measurement should be taken to confirm, unless there is already another sign of possible serious bacterial infection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                           nan                                          |                           Quantity                          |                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |     Integer    |                                                                               Range 0-120                                                                              |Yes| C |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |    nan    |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|Note that if a Repiratory rate cannot be taken at the recommended time during the consultation as per the decision tree because the child is not calm enough then this should be prompted again during the assessments, tests and labs phase of the consultation.

Fast breathing is confirmed if respiratory rate is 60 breaths a minute or more at the second count.   To measure the respiratory rate: Count the number of breaths the child takes per minute to determine if fast breathing is present. It is very important that the child is calm and still. If the child is moving or crying, you will not be able to get an accurate count of breaths.  To count the breaths per minute, use a watch with a second hand or a digital watch. Look for the breathing movement anywhere on the child’s chest or abdomen.

Ask the mother to offer the child some water in a cup or spoon (or breastfeed for a child under 6 months). Watch the child drink.  A child is not able to drink if he is not able to suck or swallow when offered a drink. A child may not be able to drink because he is lethargic or unconscious. A child is drinking poorly if the child is weak and cannot drink without help. He may be able to swallow only if fluid is put in his mouth. A child has the sign drinking eagerly and acts thirsty if it is clear that the child wants to drink. Look to see if the child reaches out for the cup or spoon when you offer him water. When the water is taken away, see if the child is unhappy because he wants to drink more. If the child takes a drink only with encouragement and does not want to drink more, he does not have the sign drinking eagerly, thirsty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                       Select one                                       |                           Coding                            |                       -

A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used. No child under 5 should be given an inhaler without a spacer.  If commercial spacers are not available, spacers can be easily made with a drink bottle (500 ml) or something similar. Using a sharp knife, cut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler. Cut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower ¾. Disregard the upper quarter of the bottle. Cut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child’s nose and be used as a mask. Flame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it. In a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.  To use an inhaler with a spacer: - Remove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well. - Insert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup. - The child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth. - A carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally. - Wait for three to four breaths and repeat. - For younger children place the cup over the child’s mouth and use as a spacer in the same way. -

You will look for chest indrawing when the child breathes IN.  In normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the child breathes IN. The child has chest indrawing if the lower chest wall (lower ribs) goes IN when the child breathes IN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                       Select one                                       |                           Boolean                           |                                                                                                  - Yes - No                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |       nan      |                                                                                   nan                                                                                  |Yes| C |                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Inhaled Bronchodilator Trial Results" != Inhaled Bronchodilator Trial Not Feasible or Available                                                                                                                                                                                                     |    nan    |IMCI chart booklet (who.int)|                                                                                                 Note that post inhaled bronchodilator trial that if Chest Indrawing is still present that the decision logic described will be 'Chest Indrawing'                                                                                                |Not classifiable|                                       Not classifiable                                      |            Not classifiable           |                                              Not classifiable                                             | unmatched |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |Not classifiable|                                                   Not classifiable                                                   |              Not classifiable             | unmatched |                                                                                                                                                                                    nan                                                                                                                                                                                   |    LA32284-4    |Change in breathing (e.g., indrawing, irregular, faster than usual, gagging, or breath holding)|https://loinc.org/LL5947-8/|   wider   |                   Target not specific to indrawing.

It is very important that the child is calm and still. If the child is moving or crying, you will not be able to get an accurate count of breaths.  To count the breaths per minute, use a watch with a second hand or a digital watch. Look for the breathing movement anywhere on the child’s chest or abdomen.  The number of breaths for ‘fast breathing’ depends on the child’s age.  - 2 to 11 months: More than 50 breaths per minute - 12 to 59 months: More than 40 breaths per minute

Conduct in a separate quiet area. 2. Explain to the caregiver the purpose of the appetite test and how it will be carried out. 3. The caregiver should wash her hands. 4. The caregiver should sit comfortably with the child on his lap. She should offer the RUTF from the packet, or put a small amount on her finger and give it to the child. 5. The caregiver should offer the child the RUTF gently, encouraging all the time. If the child refuses, then the caregiver should continue to quietly encourage the child. She can take time for the test. The child must not be forced to take the RUTF. 6. The child needs to be given plenty of water from a cup as he/she is taking the RUTF.  To pass the appetite test the child must willingly finish the minimum amount of RUTF - at least one-third of a packet of RUTF portion (92g) or 3 teaspoons from a pot within 30 minutes.

first measurement and after removing cloting to let the baby who has fever cool, or wrapping the baby who has low body temperature)  Temperature ranges for young infants under 2 months: - Under 35.5 :

Under 36.0 : hypothermia (low body temperature) - 36.0 to 38.5 : normal  - 38.5 and above: fever                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                           nan                                          |                           Quantity                          |                                                                                                      nan                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                          ('Rectal temperature (second measurement)' -

Examining a blood slide for malaria parasites using a microscope 2. Using a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) to check blood for malaria antigens Always check the quality of your blood slides if using microscopy or RDTs to ensure that the test results are reliable. Enter the results of the test: - POSITIVE – if there are malaria parasites or RDT is positive. Note if it is P. falciparum or P. vivax if able to do so especially when using microscopy. - NEGATIVE – If there are no parasites seen by microscopy, or RDT is negative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                       Select One                                       |                            Coding                           |                                                     -
